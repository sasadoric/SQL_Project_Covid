# SQL_Project_Covid

In ths project data from two tables: CovidVactinations and CovidDeaths were used.

In SQL following queries were made:

1. Percentage of deaths in population, showing likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country
2. Showing what percentage of populations got Covid
3. Looking at Countries with Highest Infection Rate comparet to population
4. Showing Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
5. Showing Continents with the highest death count per population
6. Looking at total population vs vactination, where SUM() OVER(Partition by location) were used- to get rolling number of people vactinated every day
7.  CTE and Temp table was used to further explore rolling number of vactinated people
8. Another way to :a View was created with two tables were joind on location and date to get data of rolling number of vactinated people.
